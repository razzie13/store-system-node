    <h1>RETAIL STORE SYSTEM PROJECT</h1>
    <h5>by nessumsar</h5>
    <h4>uploaded to public_html ONLY</h4>

    <p>This project emulates the back end of a small retail shop and allows staff to manage the store e-commerce page, create store signage, and use the store's point-of-sale system, as well as maintain information on each of the store's available items.</p>

    <ul>The following are the available components of the project:
        <li><a href="webstore">Store E-Commerce Site</a></li>
        <li><a href="point-of-sale">Store Point-Of-Sale System</a></li>
        <li><a href="create-full-page-signs">Store Sign-Making Kit (Full Page Signs)</a></li>
        <li><a href="frontend-produce-plu">Easy-to-print cashier produce code reference page</a></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>Significant parts of this project include:
        <li>Creating a detailed and easy-to-use product database and schema for all the characteristics of each item</li>
        <li>Creating a point-of-sale setup which automatically reads if an item has promotional pricing, adding applicable taxes, asking for an item weight if the item is sold by weight, and allowing the system to void any item a customer no longer wants</li>
        <li>Creating an e-commerce web page that lists the store's available items automatically using the database information</li>
        <li>Creating a way to easily make in-store signage which automatically uses promo pricing if an item is on sale, converts kilogram prices to pound prices, and prompts for Country of Origin information if a produce sign is being made</li>
    </ul>
